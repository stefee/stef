### content migrations at Cond√© Nast

_Flyway_ is a system for migrating content from an existing CMS into Cond√© Nast's CMS. Content can be defined as articles, authors, categories, galleries, videos and images.

We implemented a "self-service" model to allow engineers to migrate content into our CMS without any intervention from the core team.

This system was used to migrate _Vogue_ and _GQ_ websites managed by 10 different market teams onto our web platform managed in London.

### real-time shock wave simulation üí•
